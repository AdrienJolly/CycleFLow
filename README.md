# CycleFlow

This is the Python package CycleFlow. It implements the  model of thymidine analogue progression through the cell cycle described in Jolly et al. (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.09.10.291088)

The package requires the python packages numba, numpy and scipy. It is meant to be used with the package emcee which performs Monte Carlo Markov chain sampling.

## Example

We provide an example of usage of the package in a Jupyter Notebook. In the notebook we describe files required by CycleFlow and the steps to follow.

The example was generated with python version 3.8.5 and the following packages:

pandas v1.1.2
numpy v1.19.2
emcee v3.0.2
scipy v1.5.2
corner v2.1.0
numba v0.51.2
